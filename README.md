Explanation:

1. **div Styles** (Container div):
   - `width` and `height`: Sets the dimensions of the container.
   - `border`: Applies a black border around the container.

2. **Block Styles** (Individual colored blocks):
   - Different classes (a to c) apply unique background colors and translations to create three blocks with different positions.
   - `background-color`: Sets the background color using RGBA values, allowing for transparency.
   - `transform: translate(x, y)`: Applies a translation to move the block in the specified x and y directions.

The result is a container with three colored blocks positioned at different locations within the container. The `translate` transformation is used to adjust the position of each block.
